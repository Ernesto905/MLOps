# MLOps Course Code-Along

## Overview
This repository contains my personal code as I follow along with an MLOps course, which can be found [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dJPoLm_gtE&t=1958s). The intention is to build my understanding of MLOps by interacting with tools like MLFlow and ZenML.

## Purpose
The code within this repo is part of my learning process. It serves to demonstrate practical application of the concepts taught in the course and will evolve as I experiment and extend the provided examples.

## Learning Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with MLFlow and ZenML
- Understand MLOps workflows and best practices
- Improve my skills through implementation and experimentation

## Future Work
As I progress, I will enhance the project beyond the course material, aiming to broaden my knowledge and explore the full capabilities of the MLOps tools.

## Disclaimer
This repository is for educational purposes, meant to document my journey through the MLOps course.

Your suggestions and questions are welcome as they will help improve the learning experience.
